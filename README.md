# Our Story of Individuality

This repository contains the source code for a custom single-page website created by my brother, Nicolas, and I as a creative supplement for a few of our college applications (our absolute dream schools). We really wanted these schools to know WHY we were interested in them, and why we'd be a good fit.

## The Genesis: The Challenge of Duality

As identical twins, we share nearly all experiences, making it a challenge to truly differentiate ourselves through the standard college application process. When our early applications began to look remarkably similar, we realized we needed a more compelling way to convey our individual strengths and unique identities. **We created this custom website to tell a better, clearer story about who we are as individuals, not just as a pair,** thereby providing the holistic context the standard application does not easily allow.

One side benefit of this project, if the school chooses to view the website, is that they get a much more comprehensive view of who we are, and why we are a good fit, far beyond what is available in the common app.

## About This Site: Applying Entrepreneurial Principles

As students committed to a career in entrepreneurship, we applied the principles of **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** and **Scalable Design** to our application process.

Like many ambitious seniors, we are applying to a variety of institutionsâ€”reaches, targets, safeties and even a hail mary or two. We decided to put **maximum, targeted effort** into the few highly selective universities that represent **our absolute top choices-our dream schools.**

To ensure our unique story received the attention it deserved at these **top-tier institutions**, we engineered this application framework. By building a scalable narrative chassis, we could focus our limited time and resources on crafting the **hyper-specific, customized content** that demonstrates our genuine fit and commitment to the institution's unique programs and mission.

This project also helped us really think deeply about our top choices-which ended up being a gift because through the development of this challenging technical platform, we ended up excluding some schools that we previously thought were our dream targets.
