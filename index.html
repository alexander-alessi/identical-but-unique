						<h2>2008: A Singular Beginning</h2>
						<p>Some beginnings feel like more than just chance. Ours was one of them: a single fertilized egg that, in a moment of profound wonder, split—setting in motion two unique paths from a single, shared origin. From that extraordinary event, our individual stories began.</p>
					</div>
				</div>

							<h3>2008: Born a Fighter</h3>
							<p>My life started with a challenge. I was born weighing just 2.3 lbs and spent my first eight weeks in the hospital. I obviously don't remember it, but I grew up on the story of 'the little fighter.' That narrative became a core part of my identity, instilling me with resilience and a drive to overcome any obstacle. Most of the time leaping without looking, as you'll see.</p>

						<div class="timeline-event right">
							<h3>2008: Born a Brother</h3>
							<p>I was born slightly stronger than Alexander at 2.7 lbs and accompanied him in the hospital for eight weeks. My first days of life were spent right beside my twin as he fought for his life. The family story goes that I was the calm one, his steady partner. Although I cannot remember this time in my life, I do know that I have a deep-seated empathy and a desire to understand and care for the people around me. I know my early life shaped this part of my identity.</p>

							<h3>2009: Hacking the Gate</h3>
							<p>The house was full of pressure activated safety gates that we were too light to open alone. Whoever designed these things had no idea who they were dealing with. By observing my parents easily move through the gates, I realized it wasn't about my own strength, but combined weight. So I convinced Nicolas to stand on the step-lever with me, and together we popped it open. It was my first taste of operational leadership (and rule breaking): analyzing a system and recruiting the right resources to achieve a goal.</p>
							<div class="event-footer">Alexander</div>
						</div>
						<div class="timeline-event right">
							<h3>2009: Empowering My First User</h3>
							<p>My first real milestone wasn't my own. The family story is that after walking for weeks myself, I saw my brother struggling to stand on his own—he just wasn't getting it. He followed me everywhere, crawling on his hands and knees. I understood the task immediately (i.e. I took pity on him). I took him by the hands, and patiently taught him to put one foot in front of the other. It was my earliest lesson in a product leader’s true purpose: to see a user’s need and find satisfaction not in my own success, but in empowering theirs.</p>
							<div class="event-footer">Nicolas</div>

						<div class="timeline-event left">
							<h3>2015: The Rose Operation</h3>
							<p>Our yard was full of roses, but I didn't see flowers; I saw dollar signs. Mother's Day was right around the corner, so I devised a plan: calculate a price, set up a stand on the busiest corner, and turn our free, natural resource into profit. It was my first real lesson in observing a market need and devising a plan to satisfy it. We were going to be the richest 7 year olds in Walnut Creek.</p>
							<div class="event-footer">Alexander</div>
						</div>
						<div class="timeline-event right">
							<h3>2015: A Lesson in Market Reality</h3>
							<p>My mom taught me to create the perfect Mother's Day bouquets: twelve roses plus all of the complementary flowers. But as the day approached, flower stands and signs started popping up on every corner. Even Whole Foods was selling flowers! How dare they! Discouraged, I realized we had no unique advantage to offer. We never made a single bouquet. It was my first, harsh lesson in market dynamics: a great product idea is worthless without a strategy to stand out in a crowded field.</p>

							<h3>2020: The Over-Engineered Masterpiece</h3>
							<p>For six months during Covid lockdown, I hired a CAD designer on Fiverr to create a new luggage brand. Forget all of those "kid" business ideas—luggage was the key to success. Plus it's really simple, just a rectangular box where you store clothes. What could be easier? We were going to crush the competition. When we presented the prototype to a factory, they called it "the most complex design we've ever seen". It was a massive wake-up call: complex gadgets and hidden compartments are not what people want when they are traveling, they want reliability and simplicity. We didn't start by focusing on the user need, we started with building something cool. This was an absolutely crucial entrepreneurial lesson. I won't lie, it didn't sink in just yet.</p>

							<h3>2020: The Perfect, Unbuildable Suitcase</h3>
							<p>I used the quiet of Covid lockdown to help design the perfect suitcase. Working with a professional designer, we teenagers were drunk on the power we had over a professional adult, pushing for increasingly complex and crazy features. There was not a single thing that we asked for that he would not add to the design. I am 100% confident our hired gun had no idea he was working with two 12-year-olds (we only communicated through Fiverr's platform). The only tiny issue? Our masterpiece was utterly unbuildable without a massive factory and a fortune. This taught me a crucial business lesson: a product is only viable if it can actually make it into a user's hands (and a lot of user's hands).</p>

							<h3>2021: The $5,000 Tuition</h3>
							<p>My parents had always told me to take calculated risks while I'm young, because I can always recover from failure with time. They also said if I really believed in something, I should "go for it". So when I saw the advertisement for a dropshipping mentorship with the most famous person in the industry (on YouTube, of course), I thought, "this isn't even risky and I definitely have conviction to collect the millions he said I'll make". So, I spent my entire life savings on the course, genuinely believing I'd be driving a Bugatti within 12 months. The subsequent failure, where $5,000 vanished without a single sale, taught me a critical financial lesson: arrogance is not conviction, and a founder must treat capital with respect. However, this was the necessary, expensive tuition that prepared me to recognize the next, great opportunity when it finally arrived a few years later.</p>
							<div class="event-footer">Alexander</div>
						</div>
						<div class="timeline-event right">
							<h3>2021: A Costly Lesson in Faith</h3>
							<p>I blindly followed my brother into the dropshipping venture, committing my entire savings on pure faith and conviction. When the $5,000 vanished without a single sale, the true cost wasn't just financial; it was the realization that I had failed to think critically. Yes, I am an identical twin. Yes, I am exceptionally close with my brother. Yes, I love and trust him more than any other human on the planet. BUT...there is a famous phrase my father always says: "trust but verify". Never was this more appropriate. Even with your closest friends and relatives, in business, you must perform rigorous analysis and analyze all the angles. I would not make that mistake again.</p>

							<h3>2022: Embracing the Grind</h3>
							<p>Academics have never come naturally nor easily for me. The transition to high school from middle school was a shock. Everyone is talking about AP courses, PSAT, college preparation, and extracurriculars (whatever that was). I was not going to get left behind so I committed to the daily grind of high school, treating my studies with the same discipline as a sport. I earned straight A's that year and it was one of the hardest things I had ever done. This taught me one of the foundational lessons of entrepreneurship: you can't just rely on your natural strengths. Real progress comes from committing to the daily grind and outworking the challenges you aren't naturally built for.</p>
							<div class="event-footer">Alexander</div>
						</div>
						<div class="timeline-event right">
							<h3>2022: Unlocking a Creative Toolkit</h3>
							<p>My freshman Digital Design class was a true revelation for me. I didn't just learn boring classroom theory like I was used to in school; I learned how to build real digital assets with real industry tools: the logos, graphics, and presentations that bring an idea to life. I was learning to tap into a skill that I didn't know I had, and that I didn't know I enjoyed. I also learned a crucial lesson that would be invaluable later in my story, especially in the digital world: a great digital business needs more than just a complicated technical backend; it needs a compelling visual story, because without it, even the best product won't be discovered or embraced.</p>
							<div class="event-footer">Nicolas</div>
						</div>

						<div class="timeline-event left">
							<h3>2023: The Discipline of Leverage</h3>
							<p>I have always been a shy, somewhat introverted kid. Probably because I am an identical twin, and usually enter every social situation with my best friend. I knew at some point I was going to have to break out of my shell, especially if I wanted to be a successful entrepreneur. So, in typical fashion, I skipped to the end, and chose to engage in an activity that is basically the opposite of shy and introverted: Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ). Through training and competition, I tapped into a confidence and strength, both internal and external, that I didn't know I had. I also learned a profound, unavoidable life lesson: brute force is often defeated by strategy and leverage. Squaring off against opponents, I learned how to maintain calm under pressure and use intellectual analysis over raw strength—a key concept in BJJ. In business and entrepreneurship, these skills are essential for understanding a complex market, launching a quality product and beating the competition.</p>

							<h3>2023: Learning to Ask for the Ball</h3>
							<p>Trying out for the high school soccer team, which is very competitive at my school, I assumed my skills would speak for themselves. I had been playing soccer most of my life, up through middle school, so I felt pretty confident. In the end, I didn't make the cut and realized a hard truth: talent isn't enough if you're not aggressive, and you don't ask for the ball. Soccer tryouts were about showing the coach what you could do, but if you don't have the ball, you are essentially invisible. This was a crucial life lesson, and a painful one to learn: to succeed, in sports or in business, you have to actively create your own opportunities, and sometimes you only get one chance.</p>

							<h3>2024: Inside the Engine Room</h3>
							<p>I was very lucky to have an internship working in operations at a small software company called StatusDashboard. It was like seeing a business with the hood up. Finally, I was starting to see how a real startup operates. How they think. How they talk. The risks they take. And, I was trusted with real responsibility, working within the daily systems that handled customer support, managed deployments, and kept the engine running. This was so valuable. It taught me that a great digital product is actually built on a foundation of a thousand small, well-executed processes.</p>
							<div class="event-footer">Alexander</div>
						</div>
						<div class="timeline-event right">
							<h3>2024: The "Aha" Moment</h3>
							<p>My transition from an intern to an official part-time position in product development at a local startup was a key turning point for me. I gained super valuable insight into exactly how (and why) an idea makes its way through the product team to the public. Almost all of the ideas for features that this company built actually came directly from the customers. What a novelty! And they spent SO much time validating, testing and debugging ideas before they made it to the public. This was the 'aha' moment that explained my past failures: I had been building in a vacuum. This taught me one of the most critical lessons in product leadership: you must fall in love with the user's problem, not just your own solution. You also have to challenge assumptions and be willing to pivot based on feedback. What a gift this experience was!</p>

							<h3>2025: Building a Solution for Ourselves</h3>
							<p>I struggled to find a full-time summer job after junior year. I didn't want a typical, structured, hourly job. I wanted to create my own schedule that left time for my entrepreneurial pursuits. The problem was, nobody was offering kids the opportunity to create their own schedule (duh!). There was, kind of, an existing solution though: Nextdoor. Adults and kids would post about odd jobs (gigs) on Nextdoor frequently and if you got lucky, you could pick one up. It was not consistent though. Then I realized this was the opportunity we had been waiting for! I recruited my brother and our best friend Mason (and my Dad), and we set out to create the platform that would crush Nextdoor. <a href="https://jobmat.ch" target="_blank">JobMatch</a> was born in March of 2025—the first platform designed specifically to connect adults with high school teens looking for short-term jobs. We obviously struck a chord with the community because after a few missteps, pivots and relaunches, I made a simple Nextdoor post and it received 17,000 views! That was half our town! Over a weekend the platform got hundreds of sign-ups and referrals. Our <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DLpwxfqsKiR/" target="_blank">creative Instagram posts</a> circulated around local high schools like wildfire. This solidified in my mind the lesson that had been building my whole life: the most effective way to solve any market problem is to intimately understand the user's need, and in this case, we were the users.</p>

						<div class="timeline-event right">
							<h3>2025: From Mission to Media</h3>
							<p>With JobMatch live, my goal was now to prove to the world what high school teens are capable of. I had always struggled with the thought that I needed to wait until I was 25 or 30 to finish college and start a business (and make an impact on the world). Why must I wait until then? I am ready now. I created a business page on LinkedIn for JobMatch and started writing about our experiences. I started with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/one-month-how-our-naive-expertise-fueled-jobmatchs-launch-jobmat-ch-g8cdc/" target="_blank">reflections on our launch lessons</a> which was read by many adult professionals, not just high school kids. This gave us the audience to later <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/busting-myth-gen-z-hustling-slacking-jobmat-ch-o4tic/" target="_blank">bust the myth that Gen Z is lazy</a>. The buzz around high school kids creating a digital employment platform for youth earned us featured interviews with local and national news outlets like <a href="https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2025/09/04/walnut-creek-students-start-jobmatch-service-for-teens-young-adults/?share=usr4srtytgrtytmr0oca" target="_blank">the East Bay Times</a> and <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/teens-from-upper-income-families-are-far-more-likely-to-work-summer-jobs-than-poor-teens-whats-going-on-e695fca2" target="_blank">MarketWatch</a>. The core lesson here was extremely powerful and meaningful to me: true inspiration comes from defying expectations and proving that execution of great ideas only requires bold action, not permission.</p>
